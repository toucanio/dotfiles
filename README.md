# Dotfiles

This is a collection of OS X and Ubuntu dotfiles collected from a variety of public repositories found [here][here] on Github and my rather small personal collection--and perhaps most heavily (like 95%) influenced by the excellent repos of [Mathias Bynens][Mathias Bynens] and ["Cowboy" Ben Alman]["Cowboy" Ben Alman].

## Why is git useful for maintaining collections of dotfiles?

Git provides a mechanism to implement incremental changes to these files on a line by line basis, while also providing a repository to draw from when it comes time to automate the setup of a fresh computer or update previously installed components.
